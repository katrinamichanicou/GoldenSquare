# Reflections from Takeaway Project

What went well: 

    1. I was able to achieve all the user requirements.

    2. I added in a few more methods, which I believe would improve usability.

    3. I was able to use techniques I had not dealt with before, 
       eg. input(), Twilio and a new datetime() use.

    4. I was able to set up .gitignore and twilio.env in order to store sensitive info
       that will not be added to github.
       
    5. I feel like this project helped me understand classes more
       as well as working with data structures within those classes.


What didn't go well:

    1. I don't think I did a great job in the planning stage.
       I could have spent more time planning. 
       When it came to execution I changed a lot of the structure and some of the methods
       This made it clear that it wasn't well thought out

    2. I didn't test-drive very well. I think this is mainly because of the use of input(),
       which I was not confident on how to include this in testing. (*something to learn)

    3. I didn't have time to add in Exceptions / error messages

Potential Improvements:
    1. I could add additional Exceptions / error messages to make the code more robust.

    2. I could learn how to test input().

    3. I could potentitally refactor some of the code.

    4. I could refactor the class structure.
